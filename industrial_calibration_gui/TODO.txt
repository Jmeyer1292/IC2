TODO List:

- Save tf transforms and camera_info (currently only saving images).

- Potentially zip up the data instead of throwing it all into a directory.

- Figure out what to do if camera_info topic publishes all zeros.
  Set the parameters manually (modification to the GUI).

- Add checkboxes for manual data collection, automated data collection, or loading
  existing data.

- Load a generic robot model into the display.

- Moveit to drag robot around instead of manually jogging. (use existing moveit panel).

- Add an interactive marker to set target pose "guess" position.

- Generate fake target dots in RViz 3D view of target guess position.

- Project 2D image onto 3D plane and generate a simulated target so when calibration
  is completed, they should line up.
