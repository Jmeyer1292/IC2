TODO List:

- Add a stacked page to allow for re-running a calibration with existing data. (Low Priority).

- Potentially zip up the data instead of throwing it all into a directory. (Low Priority).

- Figure out what to do if camera_info topic publishes all zeros.
  Set the parameters manually (modification to the GUI). (Low Priority).

- Add checkboxes for manual data collection, automated data collection, or loading
  existing data.

- Load a generic robot model into the display.

- Moveit to drag robot around instead of manually jogging. (use existing moveit panel).

- Add an interactive marker to set target pose "guess" position.

- Generate fake target dots in RViz 3D view of target guess position.

- Project 2D image onto 3D plane and generate a simulated target so when calibration
  is completed, they should line up.
